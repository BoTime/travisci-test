### Testing frameworks
Mocha or Jasmine
https://raygun.com/blog/mocha-vs-jasmine-chai-sinon-cucumber/
https://www.codementor.io/codementorteam/javascript-testing-framework-comparison-jasmine-vs-mocha-8s9k27za3

Jasmine is more of a battery-included framework that comes with its own assertion library.
Will start with Jasmine and try Mocha later.
